# 🏠 California Housing Price Prediction using PyTorch (Mini Project)

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for predicting median house values using the California Housing dataset. It uses PyTorch and scikit-learn, with basic preprocessing and visualization.

## 🔧 Features
- Data preprocessing with imputation and normalization
- MLP with ReLU and Dropout layers
- Training with MSE loss and Adam optimizer
- Visualization of predictions vs. actual values

## 📈 Dataset
- Source: `fetch_california_housing()` from scikit-learn

## 📊 Target
- Predict the median house value in California census blocks

## 📦 Requirements
See [`environment.yml`](./environment.yml)
